                    <Run Text="Projectile motion is a branch of classical mechanics in which the motion of an object (the projectile) is analyzed under the influence of the constant acceleration of gravity, after it has been propelled with some initial velocity. The effect of air resistance may also be included in the analysis. Projectile motion would include, for example, calculating the trajectory of a ball that has been thrown or that of a bullet fired from a gun. Airplanes and birds are not considered projectiles because they are self-propelled. Neglecting air resistance, it is relatively easy to calculate the height reached, the horizontal distance travelled, and the object's velocity at any point in time, given only the initial velocity and the angle at which the projectile was propelled."></Run>
