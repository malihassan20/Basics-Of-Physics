It is composed of a positively charged nucleus in the center, made up of protons and neutrons, and a cloud of negatively charged electrons. While the nucleus is very dense, accounting for more than 99.9% of an atom's mass, the electron cloud is what gives an atom its size. For example, if the atomic nucleus were the size of a baseball, the atom would be the diameter of a baseball park. Although the concept of the atom has been around since ancient Greece ('atom' comes from the Greek word for 'indivisible'), it was only in the mid-20th century that scientists accurately measured the structure of the atom."></Run>
