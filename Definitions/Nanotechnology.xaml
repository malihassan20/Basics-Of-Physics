                    <Run Text="Nanotechnology is the study of controlling matter on the scale of 1 to 100 nanometers (a nanometer is one-billionth of a meter). The physical and chemical properties of many materials are new and unique at such small sizes (for reference, a human hair is approximately 100,000 nanometers thick), giving rise to a large number of promising technologies. The idea of nanotechnology is attributed to Richard P. Feynman, a physicist at the California Institute of Technology, who in 1959 presented a famous talk called 'There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom'.However, it wasn't until the 1980s that the necessary tools were developed to make nanotechnology a reality. Nanotechnology is a rapidly emerging field of study in areas including medicine, device physics, electronics, and computing."></Run>
