                    <Run Text="Electricity is a general term that refers to the presence and flow of electric charge. For example, electricity is present in lightning, electrical outlets, and static electricity. Recognized since ancient Greece, electricity wasn't harnessed by engineers until the late 19th century, when it began to be used to provide power to homes and businesses. Electricity is used today to power anything from light bulbs to computers to cars. Electricity is most commonly generated by electromagnetic induction, by moving a loop of wire or a disc of copper between the poles of magnet. Electricity can be generated from burning fuels such as natural gas, oil, and coal, from nuclear fission reactions, from windmills or hydroelectric plants, or from solar panels."></Run>
