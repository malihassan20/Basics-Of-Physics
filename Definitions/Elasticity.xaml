                    <Run Text="In physics, elasticity is the property of a material whose dimensions can be changed by applying a force to it (for example, pushing, pulling, twisting, or compressing), but subsequently returns to its original shape. The deforming force is called a stress, and the deformation is called the strain. Every material is elastic to some degree, although rubber is far more elastic than metal or stone, for example. The forces acting between individual atoms or molecules in a material determine the degree of elasticity. The principal law governing elasticity is known as Hooke's law, which states that the stress is linearly proportional to the strain. For example, when a spring is stretched, the force needed to pull it is proportional to the distance it is extended."></Run>
