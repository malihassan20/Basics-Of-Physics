                    <Run Text="Waves are periodic disturbances that travel through space and time. There are three main types: mechanical, electromagnetic, and matter. Mechanical waves travel only through a medium, such as air or water, and are governed by Newton's laws of motion. These are most familiar, and include water waves, sound waves, and seismic waves. Electromagnetic waves are less familiar, but just as ubiquitous. They include visible light, radio waves, microwaves, X-rays, and radar waves. Electromagnetic waves do not need any medium to travel through, and move at the speed of light (approximately 3x108 meters per second). Matter waves are least familiar, although they are common in modern technology. Electrons, protons, and other fundamental particles can move as waves. Matter waves arise from the wave-particle duality of matter."></Run>
