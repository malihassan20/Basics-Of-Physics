                    <Run Text="The General theory of relativity is a theory of gravitation developed by Albert Einstein. Published in 1915, it encompasses Newton's law of gravitation, but shows that it breaks down when gravity is very strong. General relativity states that the gravitational attraction between two masses is due to a curvature of space-time. Objects with greater mass cause greater curvature, resulting in a strong gravitational force. Einstein proposed that if mass caused space-time to warp, then objects traveling in that curved space would have their paths deflected, just as if a force had acted upon them. The most famous confirmation of a prediction of general relativity came during the total solar eclipse in May 1919, when the bending of light by the sun's gravity was first observed."></Run>
