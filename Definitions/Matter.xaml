                    <Run Text="The common definition of matter is anything that both has mass and takes up space (that is, has volume). All physical objects consist of matter, which is made up of atoms composed of protons, neutrons, and electrons. Matter typically exists in one of four phases: solid, liquid, gas, or plasma (although other phases are possible). Matter, like light, exhibits both wave-like and particle-like properties, even though matter in daily life seems to behave strictly as a particle. For example, electrons accelerated to very high speeds (approaching the speed of light) display the properties of waves very clearly (they diffract and interfere as waves do). Although all matter has wave-like properties, those properties are generally very hard to measure under normal conditions."></Run>
