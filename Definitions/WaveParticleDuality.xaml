                    <Run Text="Wave-particle duality is the concept that all matter exhibits the properties of both waves and particles. Central to quantum mechanics, the idea that light and matter can be treated as both wave-like and particle-like properties has been verified experimentally for subatomic particles, light, and even atoms and molecules. For example, matter can interfere with itself and also diffract, showing wave-like properties. And yet the photoelectric effect is clear evidence that light consists of discrete particle-like packets of energy, called photons. Seemingly contradictory, wave-particle duality implies that matter and light are both particles and waves. In reality, they are both and neither. The concepts of waves and particles, while familiar, are simply insufficient to accurately describe the true nature of matter."></Run>
